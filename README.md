## FÃ¡ilte!

I go by many names on the web, but for most programming stuff I am Privacy_Dragon! <br>
I did programming for calculators in C and sometimes in TI-BASIC. I have also started programming in Java for Android apps.
As someone who has too many hobbies, while also attending university (Celtic Studies), I have only a limited amount of time for programming and coding.
