## Hello everyone!

I go by many names on the web, but for most programming stuff I am Privacy_Dragon! <br>
I do programming for calculators in C and sometimes still in TI-BASIC. I also program for the computer sometimes in several languages. I am on Mastodon, where I have my account on a instance with much blind/visual-impaired people. I myself can just see, but being on that instance has made me realize the importance of accessibility. Therefore I try to make my computer programs accessible for screenreaders and I would add accesssibility to a good project if possible too. <br>
Speaking of which, I still want to try to add more accessibility to any project.<br>
I am currently unlikely to spend much time on programming, however, for I find that I often spent too much time on it and I have a lot of other things to do in my life too.
